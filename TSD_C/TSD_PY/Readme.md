## Dataset

The model is trained using the TUSZ V2.0.0 dataset. You need to download this dataset before running the code.

## Preprocessing

To preprocess the TUSZ v2.0.0 dataset:

1. Navigate to the `TSD/code` directory.
2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python tuh_dataset.py --data_directory /path/to/the/TUSZV2/dataset --save_directory /path/to/save/the/preprocessed/signals
    ```

This script applies filtering to the input signals, converts them to bipolar montage, and extracts STFT files. Note that this process may take some time.

## Training

To train the Transformer model:

1. Navigate to the `TSD/code` directory.
2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python best_model.py --data_directory /path/to/the/TUSZV2/dataset --save_directory /path/to/save/the/preprocessed/signals
    ```

The trained model will be saved in a directory called `out_model` inside the `save_directory`.

## Notes

- If you're not using a GPU, change the `device` variable in the code from 'cuda' to 'cpu'.
- The `TSD/code/TUSZv2_info.json` file contains pre-extracted labeling information used in preprocessing.
